Rephrase that question to make it understandable

Hi
Thanks for the clarification. In that case a CRS sign off should be required. A code change can be considered as a material change. However, requesting you to confirm the below (for any other changes that might be considered as a material change).
1. Programming code, business logic or architectural changes support the addition of significant features
2. The data footprint changes, including new data interfaces into the application, changes to the structure of the data
model or new downstream interfaces.
3. The risk criteria change: data classification, business impact analysis rating, application exposure.

Regards!

## Output:
Is a sign-off from CRS required for any changes that can be considered as a material change in the programming code, business logic, or architecture of the application, including changes to the data footprint, data structure, and risk criteria?
