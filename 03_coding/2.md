## Vulnarability Fixing 


## Example 
Code: subprocess.run(f'rm -rf {path_to_zipfile}', shell=True, cwd=classifier_root_path) 

Finding: 
Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')

Description: This call to open() contains a path manipulation flaw. The argument to the function is a filename constructed using user-supplied input. If an attacker is allowed to specify all or part of the filename, it may be possible to gain unauthorized access to files on the server, including those outside the webroot, that would be normally be inaccessible to end users. The level of exposure depends on the effectiveness of input validation routines, if any.
