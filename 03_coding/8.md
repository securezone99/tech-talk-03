## Explain Regex examples


## Example 
Explain the following regex: 
^([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,5})$ 

## Output:
The regular expression ^([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)@([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)\.([a-zA-Z]{2,5})$ is used to match and validate an email address.

Here is an explanation of each part of the regex:

^ - matches the start of a string.

([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+) - matches one or more characters that are letters (lowercase or uppercase), digits, underscore, hyphen, or dot. This pattern is repeated twice, with the first instance matching the username part of the email address and the second instance matching the domain name.

@ - matches the at symbol that separates the username and the domain name in an email address.

\. - matches a dot, used to separate the domain name and the top-level domain (TLD) in the email address.

[a-zA-Z]{2,5} - matches a sequence of 2 to 5 letters, used to match the TLD of the email address.

$ - matches the end of a string.

Together, this regex matches and validates strings that follow the pattern of a typical email address, with a username, an at symbol, a domain name, and a TLD, separated by dots.
