# Description
## Act as Person/Team and Support the day 2 day work 


## Example 
You will act as a development team in a scrum framework that includes backend, frontend, devops and testing subteams. 

The tech stack used is Angular with RxJS, .Net, signalR, rabbitmq, codeceptjs for creating Frontend E2E tests, mongodb, minio (storage). 

You will be given user stories and I would like you to create Acceptance Criterias (AC's) to complete the feature as a professional development team would create them. Please create all AC's to cover the microservices involved as well as the testing part. 

Please create the AC's in the following format:

Explanation of the current architecture that must be considered: 

Angular frontend is connected to .Net backend via websockets (signalR). Frontend changes are done by the frontend team.
.Net backend is connected to minio, mongoDB and other python and java microservices. Backend changes are done by the backend team.
Frontend E2E tests are created in codeceptJS by the testing team.
Unit tests need to be written for all microservices.
All microservices are deployed in kubernetes after the changes have been implemented  via helm. Deployments can be done by frontend and backend developers. 

Additionally, add the estimated time in hours it would take for an junior developer to complete each AC and explain in details why you believe it will take that estimated time. Be also careful to not repeat your AC's! 

Also add your estimated effort at the end by selecting on off the following:
very easy and can be done in 1 day
normal and can be done in 2-3 days
complex and can be done in 5 days 
more complex, but can be done in a 10 days 
very complex and cannot be done in a 10 days 
too complex and cannot be done in a 20 days

All changes need an AC to deploy a stage deployment with the changes but a production deployment is always out of scope for all AC's.

When creating AC's, please only think of AC's that involve the following teams: Frontend Team and Test Team

Here is your User Story:  

As a developer i want to be able to use angular with graphql and cosmosdb to create a new protopy architecture for gpt

## Output:

AC 1:
Given: The development team is using Angular with RxJS, .Net, signalR, rabbitmq, codeceptjs for creating Frontend E2E tests, mongodb, minio (storage).
When: The development team wants to use Angular with graphql and cosmosdb.
Then: The development team should create a new prototype architecture for GPT using Angular and graphql with cosmosdb.
Estimated time: 20 hours
Explanation: To create a new prototype architecture, the frontend team needs to implement the Angular and graphql framework, integrate with the cosmosdb, and test the changes. Additionally, the testing team needs to write and run tests to ensure the changes meet the desired outcomes. This process is estimated to take 20 hours as it involves creating a new prototype architecture, which requires a significant amount of time and effort.

AC 2:
Given: The development team is using Angular with RxJS, .Net, signalR, rabbitmq, codeceptjs for creating Frontend E2E tests, mongodb, minio (storage).
When: The development team wants to implement graphql in Angular.
Then: The development team should implement graphql in the Angular frontend.
Estimated time: 10 hours
Explanation: To implement graphql in Angular, the frontend team needs to integrate the framework, test the changes, and ensure the desired outcomes are met. The testing team will also need to run tests to validate the changes. This process is estimated to take 10 hours as it only involves integrating a new framework, which should be a relatively straightforward process.
